# Project T

This is a 2D pixel game designed for 1–2 players (local multiplayer on the same laptop/keyboard). It was developed using GameMaker Studio.

Unfortunately, the original project files and source code are no longer accessible, as they were stored on my old, broken laptop. Thankfully, I was able to preserve the executable version of the game. I’m grateful to still have that!
